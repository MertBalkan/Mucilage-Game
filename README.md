# Mucilage-Game

Here is the last project that I create in Unity Engine. 
This project has been created for Mobile Platforms but I added jump input for the computer as a space button. On mobile platforms, you can press the UI button at the bottom of the screen. 

So there are 2 things that I need to be mention. First, there is a stuck capacity in my game. That means when you collect sea wastes from the sea. The pipe that we're using is getting stuck every time and in that case, the pipe stuck slide bar increases and this happens 5 times in the game then you are losing it. Second, there is a fuel slide that you can see on the left top of the game. This means every second your fuel is getting lower. But you can collect oils from the sea and that will increase it! Also throughout the game, you can see the sea is getting clean and its colour is changing to blue.


Well, I suppose that's all for now!

I think I should improve my design skills :p. See you 'till then to the next projects!

Cheers!
